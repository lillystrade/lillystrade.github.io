		<h4> Travel </h4>
		<p> My family has went on many vacations throughout my life. My parents love to invest in experiences rather than physical items, therefore, we went on many vacations. I have been to Mexico, Punta Cana, Jamaica, Bahamas, California, Florida, New York, Arizona, and many other U.S. States. After graduation, I will be taking a 6 week long trip abroad with my friends to visit many travel destinations. My mom will also be joining me for a week in Paris, France! </p>

		<h4> Cooking & Baking </h4>
		<p> My mom and dad have taught me to love cooking and baking. I love the creativity aspect of it like trying out new recipes, decorating a cake, making treats for a party or gift, etc... During the summer, I spend a lot of time baking, whereas during the school year, I spend more time cooking. It is something that both of my parents and I love to do together, as well. </p>

<div class="reading">
		<h4> Reading </h4>
		<p> Reading is something that has come and gone throughout my years. I read a lot as a little kid, and fell out of this habit in middle school and high school. However, this past year, I have fell in love with it again. My goal for 2024 is to read 20 books! I keep track of all my progress and ratings on an app called "GoodReads." This is something that helps to calm my mind at the end of the night. </p>
