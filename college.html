	<p> I am a Junior at the <strong> University of Wisconsin - Madison </strong>, studying Consumer Behavior and Marketplace Studies with certificates in Entrepreneurhsip and Digital Studies.</p>
<p> I have a passion for the everchanging world of retail. I am currently the Vice President of Internal Relations for <a href="https://www.srauwmadison.com/"> <strong>The Student Retail Association</strong> </a> at UW-Madison. Through this club, I have gained valuable knowledge and have had many unique experiences. These include:
<ul>
<li><a> Networking with retail professionals</a></li>
<li><a> Attending speaker events with professionals from big name retail companies</a></li>
<li><a> Traveling to different corporate headquarters to get a real sense of the industry
</a></li>
<li><a>The opportunity to attend the National Retail Federation's Student Progam in New York City</a></li>
<li><a>Meet other students within my major that have similar interests</a></li>
</ul>

I am currently the Student Coordinator for the Leadership Certificate at the <a href="https://cfli.wisc.edu/leadership-certificate-info-packet/"> <strong>Center for Leadership & Involvement </strong>  </a> at UW-Madison. I started this position this past January and am currently loving it!
</p>
<p>
This past summer, I attended Kohl's Early Talent Summit. I heard from many different professionals about their experience working for Kohl's. I also learned about Kohl's mission, visions, and values. Additionally, I participated in a Case Competition challenging me and my team to come up with an idea that expands Kohl's customer base. This was a great opportunity for me to use the skills that I have learned in my first two years of college and build out an idea with my team.
</p>
<p>
My completion of the Talent Summit provided me with an early interview for an internship for the summer of 2024. This Summer, I will be an <strong> Assistant Merchant Intern at Kohl's Corporate Office </strong> in Menomonee Falls, WI. I am super excited to apply all of the skills and knowledge that I have learned here at UW, but also learn so much more as an intern! I am specifically excited to not only learn about the merchant position, but also shadow other departments to get a sense for my future. </p>
